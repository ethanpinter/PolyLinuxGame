/ Thoughts
    - instead of using bash to create levels, use python to allow for easy use of 2D arrays
    - arch linux uses python 3.9.9, supports import os to allow directory creation
    - started change over to large bash master array to create folder names
    - python implementation is MUCH better and MUCH faster than bash

//
    - not an easy way/impossible to export associative arrays in bash (as stated by the maintainer of bash) https://www.mail-archive.com/bug-bash@gnu.org/msg01774.html
        - so.. python? assuming we can get arch to work the way we need; otherwise, let the master array live inside each level script? this seems unnecessary and overcomplex
        - other solution that works in both environments, create master array as a temporary file that each install script can call from using file manipulation in bash (cut, head, grep)
        - another alternative, pass variables to the install scripts via positional parameters (./level1.sh arg1 arg2 arg3 ... argN )
/// To-Do
    - instead of using export for master array, write it to a file and use file manipulation in buildroot (cut, head)
    - redo level structure for better polymorphism, no duplicates because of hash duplicates
    - .
    - buildroot for easy levels, arch for harder

    // each level script pulls from the masterArray file indiviudually using cut <- had to use sed instead

// issues 6/29
/ FIXED THIS - sh doesn't support string indexing (pseudoRANDcapture2=${noDupsHash:3:1})
/ FIXED THIS - doesn't support string append (+=), no easy way to append to strings in sh?, therefore no way to eliminate duplicates in a string?
/ make sure all pseudoRAND has +1 added to account for zeros, there must be 17 items in 17 lists
/ get noDupsHash working to strip off duplicates in hash, make sure order or digits stays same as this matters for md5 hash of ls -R in verify script
